# Amazon Web Service

## Brief

Store data in AWS DynamoDB.

## Steps

### On AWS Level

1. Open AWS website and sign in.
2. You should have previously created an iot thing.
3. Go to your iot core > act > rules
4. Click on create new rule , pick a name for your rule  
5. Now select the latest version of sql and in the query statement type this `select *, timestamp () as ts from outTopic`.
6. Choose add Action and in select one action choose  `split messages into db columns in dynamic db table`.
7. On configure action choose create new resource. 
8. That will lead you to the dynamo db console where you need to create a table , choose your table name and in the partition key put your primary key , the add sort key and put the field you want, then uncheck the write and read capacity and put that value to one.
9. Now in configure action > create new resource you need to put your table name.
10. Now click on create role and rename your role 
11. Now click on add action then create rule

### On Arduino Level

1. First we need to download the tool archive`ESP8266FS-0.4.0.zip` from the Git hub releases page.
2. Extract this folder to /ESP8266FS/tool/esp8266fs.jar
3. Create a folder tools in Arduino sketchbook directory if already not created 
4. Place the downloaded folder into the tools created folder and restart your Arduino 
5. Select `tools > ESP8266 Sketch Data Upload` will be there.
6. You need the aws-endpoint from aws , go to settings in your aws iot core and you will find it
7. After converting the certificates to .der , place them in a folder called data and place the folder in the same sketch with the Arduino code
